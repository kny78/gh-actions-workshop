Congratulations, you've completed the workshop! ðŸŽ‰
You now have a good understanding of how to create workflows with GitHub Actions.
There is still a lot more to learn, so let's explore some resources to help you on your journey.

## GitHub Actions documentation

The [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a great place to learn more about GitHub Actions.
It contains detailed information about all the features and concepts we've covered in this workshop.

## `act`

[`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) lets you run your GitHub Actions locally.
This is useful for testing your workflows before pushing changes to your repository.

## `actionlint`

[`actionlint`](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) is a GitHub Actions workflow file linter.
It checks your workflow files for syntax errors and other issues.

## More topics
